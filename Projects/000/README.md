## Objective

Create a TCP or UDP server that can receive messages.

## Design

This solution implements a simple TCP server written in C. The server opens
a listener on the user-specified port and accepts a single message per connection.
The server listens until the process is killed.

## Conclusion

Beej's guide was very useful!
