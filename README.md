# 100  Red Team Projects for Pentesters and Network Managers

Red Teaming is one of the most attractive fields in offensive security or ethical hacking.
Every day professionals and students are learning, creating and exploiting all types of
systems. The internet is not only the most common means through which people interact
and chat, but also a place where they are constantly exposed to a world where anyone can be monitored,
exploited, tracked or scammed.

This is why us, programmers, take action; several of us continually try to protect this
wonderful place while others, out of immaturity or shrewd interests, act in just the opposite direction.
If you're interested in this field and want to join it, no matter your current level of knowledge, learning
how to create your own tools will result in great advantage as a pentester.

So I put some thought into it and got the idea to create this project list aimed at anyone who is interested
in learning "how to" not become the ultimate script kiddie. Here I discriminate (based solely on my own experience)
almost 100 types of projects that you should at least try to either implement or study.

I recommend you to do them on the programming language you are most comfortable with. Implementing these
projects will definitely help you gain more experience and, consequently, master the language. They are divided
in categories, ranging from super basic to advanced projects.

If you enjoy this list please take the time to recommend it to a friend and follow me! I will be happy with that :)

And remember: With great power comes... (we already know).
